# Rover Rush

Welcome to Rover Rush, an engaging web-based platformer game where players control a futuristic rover collecting colorful stones across various challenging levels. Developed collaboratively for a family talent show, this game features unique artwork inspired by a child's imagination, fun gameplay mechanics, and easy access through web browsers.

## Game Overview

Rover Rush challenges players to maneuver a rover across different platforms, collecting stones while avoiding obstacles and utilizing boost mechanics. Players must strategize the use of their rover's booster, which can enhance jumping abilities at the cost of added weight from collected stones.

### Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Each level presents unique challenges with varied layouts and obstacles.
- **Boost Mechanic**: Use the rover's boost to jump higher and reach difficult places. Beware, carrying more stones could affect your jump!
- **Interactive Elements**: Drop zones where stones can be offloaded to adjust the rover's weight.
- **Family-Created Art**: All game graphics are derived from original drawings, providing a charming and unique aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

- **Phaser 3**: A powerful framework for building fun and fast 2D games for the web.
- **JavaScript**: The scripting language used to create dynamic game logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the game's webpage.
